# Employee Retention & Performance Analysis

This project analyzes synthetic HR data to uncover trends in employee tenure, performance, and compensation. 

## 🚀 Key steps
- **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values, standardized text fields, parsed inconsistent dates, validated email addresses, and transformed numerical data using pandas and numpy.
- **Feature Engineering:** Calculated tenure in days and years from join and leave dates.
- **Visualization:** Explored age and salary distributions, departmental salary differences, average tenure by department, hiring trends over years, and correlations using seaborn and matplotlib.
- **Machine Learning Prep:** Encoded categorical variables to prepare data for predictive modeling with scikit-learn.

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries
- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)

## 📁 Files
- `employees.csv`: Original messy dataset (1,200 records)
- `Employee_Retention_Analysis.ipynb`: Fully documented Jupyter notebook with cleaning, visualization, and feature engineering
- `cleaned_employees.csv`: Cleaned dataset ready for modeling or dashboarding

🎯 **Goal:** Showcase best practices in data wrangling, EDA, and preparation for predictive HR analytics.
